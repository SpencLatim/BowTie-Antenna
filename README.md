### Bowtie Antenna

The idea behind this project was to create an antenna for communicating with satellites. From this goal, it was determined that the antenna must be omnidirectional, operating mostly within the C-Band (4-8 GHz), with as much gain as possible. It was also determined to have atleast a -10dB S11 value within that C-Band range. This project can be marked as complete, although in the future this antenna could be recreated for RFIC design reasons.
