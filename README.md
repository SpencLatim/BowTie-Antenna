### Bowtie Antenna

The idea behind this project was to create an antenna for communicating with satellites. From this goal, it was determined that the antenna must be omnidirectional, operating mostly within the C-Band (4-8 GHz), with as much gain as possible. It was also determined to have atleast a -10dB S11 value within that C-Band range. This project can be marked as complete, although in the future this antenna could be recreated for RFIC design reasons.

The aedt files can be imported into Ansys HFSS, which was the modeling program used to design and optimize the bowtie antenna. The following link shows where the idea for using this antenna was come up with and also the theory behind the antenna: https://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/wideband/bowtie.php . No specific constraints regarding the size or thickness of the antenna were used when designing this antenna. The focus was purely on getting as much bandwidth and gain as possible. With more time, an array of bowties would be created to increase these parameters. The photos folder shows the different graphs that were used to evaluate the design. In the future, more documentation regarding the progress of these graphs will be done.
